## 🛠️ How It Works

This is a **pure static website** (HTML + CSS + JS) hosted on GitHub Pages.

It uses a public third-party API that wraps yt-dlp to fetch video formats.

**Note:** Public APIs can sometimes become slow or unavailable.  
If that happens → the app shows a friendly error message.

## 📱 Mobile Friendly

Tested and looks great on phones!  
Just open the link in Chrome/Safari → paste URL → download.
